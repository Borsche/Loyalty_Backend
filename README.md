# Loyalty_Backend

A reworked Version of my old Loyalty_Backend Service. This version was rewritten in Node.js from my old Java Project.
This Version is still WIP and I will keep updating it when I have the time for it.

## Features
Here is a list of features which will be implemented. The ones marked with not implemted already exist in the Java Project but are not yet implemented in this version.
The ones marked with Planned are also not implemented in the Java version.

- Create/Edit/Save Commands

### Not Implemented
- Getting points while watching 
- Command Scopes
- Minigames (a little dice game versus other players)
- Casino (Slotmachine, HorseRacing, Predictions)

### Planned
- Getting points for reaching specific achievements
- User Management through API
